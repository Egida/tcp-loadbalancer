# Proof-of-Work TCP Load Balancer

Protect your network from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks with our innovative TCP load balancer that leverages a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm for enhanced security. This open-source solution is designed to distribute incoming TCP traffic across multiple servers while incorporating a PoW challenge to mitigate and deter potential DDoS threats.

## Features

- **TCP Load Balancing:** Efficiently distribute incoming TCP traffic across a pool of servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and preventing server overload.

- **Proof-of-Work (PoW) Protection:** Integrate a PoW algorithm into the load balancing process to create an additional layer of security. By requiring clients to solve a computational challenge before establishing a connection, the system can identify and filter out malicious traffic associated with DDoS attacks.

- **Customizable PoW Parameters:** Fine-tune the PoW parameters to strike a balance between security and performance, allowing you to adapt the system to your specific needs and requirements.

- **Scalability:** Easily scale your infrastructure horizontally by adding more servers to the pool. The load balancer dynamically adjusts to accommodate new resources and distribute the load effectively.

- **Logging and Monitoring:** Gain insights into the system's performance with comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities. Track connection attempts, PoW validations, and overall system health.

- **Open Source:** Access the complete source code to review, modify, and contribute to the project. Collaborate with the community to enhance the load balancer's capabilities and security features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the load balancer settings, including PoW parameters and server pool details.
3. Build and deploy the load balancer on your network.
4. Monitor the system using the provided logging and monitoring tools.
